# Hackathon 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Javascript

We said that we won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What we learned

Working with JSON file are definitely the best choice in every challenge that requires dynamic implementation

### Continued development

We want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on our own time
